# Base Gatsby Project

## What is this?
This is a base project to clone when starting a new Gatsby project;
it was designed to include the most helpful things when building applications in 
Gatsby. It was also put together to avoid using the publically available base 
projects that may or may not be bloated and contain unwanted or unnecessary
code.

## Prerequisites
  - Node/NPM.
  - `gatsby-cli` must be installed.
